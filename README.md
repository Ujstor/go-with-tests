# [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

Learning Go with Tests is not just about reading through chapters – it's an immersive journey where you actively engage with the language by writing tests. Go is a fantastic language for learning TDD, and we're here to guide you every step of the way.

## How to Learn Go with Tests

### 1. **Interactive Learning**

Move beyond traditional methods. Instead of simply reading, we encourage you to actively explore language concepts, solidify your understanding with examples, and discuss them in an interactive group setting. Learning by doing is at the core of this approach.

### 2. **Fundamentals First**

Rather than overwhelming you with intricate details, we start by slowly introducing the fundamentals of the language. Think of it as practicing scales when learning to play an instrument – understanding the basics is crucial before building complex systems.

### 3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

We believe in the power of TDD. You'll write tests to verify your code's correctness, creating a solid foundation for understanding and documenting the features you learn. This practical approach ensures you not only grasp the concepts but also gain hands-on experience.
